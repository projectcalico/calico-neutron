* Stubout work in progress
* Merging quantum extenions framework into trunk. Thanks rajaram vinkesh, deepak & santhosh for the great work!
* - added network and port models into the l2network plugin instead of using quantum models - added api methods for network and ports - restructured code to use the l2network network and port - added l2network base class for other tables to inherit - added support for l2network plugin model objects to behave like dictionary (gets rid of code to convert objects into dictionaries) - added foreign key constraints to l2network plugin model attributes representing columns - added attributes to represent relation between models in l2network plugin - added joinedload only to network and port (need to to for others) - added InnoDB as the storage medium in base table for imposing foreign keys - updated l2network test cases to handle foreign key constraints
